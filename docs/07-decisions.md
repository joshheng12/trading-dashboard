# 07 — Decision Log (ADRs)

Lightweight Architecture Decision Records. Append a new entry whenever a meaningful
decision is made. Keep them short.

---

## ADR-001 — Front-end framework: Vue 3

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Need a modern reactive framework for a portfolio SPA.
- **Decision:** Use Vue 3 with the Composition API and `<script setup>`.
- **Consequences:** Pairs with Pinia + Vue Router; great DX and TS support.

## ADR-002 — Language: TypeScript

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Want type safety and a stronger portfolio signal.
- **Decision:** Use TypeScript throughout.
- **Consequences:** Slightly more setup; better tooling and fewer runtime bugs.

## ADR-003 — State management: Pinia

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Use Pinia (official Vue store) for app state.
- **Consequences:** Typed, modular stores; simple DevTools integration.

## ADR-004 — UI: PrimeVue + Tailwind CSS

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Want rich components (tables, menus) plus flexible responsive layout.
- **Decision:** PrimeVue (Aura dark, styled mode) for components; Tailwind +
  `tailwindcss-primeui` for layout/responsive and shared tokens.
- **Consequences:** Clear division of labor; avoids CSS conflicts.

## ADR-005 — Theme: dark-first

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Trading apps are typically dark; green/red pop on dark backgrounds.
- **Decision:** Build dark-first; add light theme as a later toggle.
- **Consequences:** Design tokens defined for dark; light variant deferred to the Polish
  phase (since delivered — persisted light/dark toggle).

## ADR-006 — Charts: lightweight-charts

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Use TradingView's `lightweight-charts` for price/candlestick charts;
  custom SVG `Sparkline` for inline mini-charts.
- **Consequences:** Purpose-built financial charts; small bundle.

## ADR-007 — Data strategy: mock-first

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** UI should be solid before depending on a rate-limited external API.
- **Decision:** Start with mock/static JSON behind a service layer; integrate a real
  provider in a later phase.
- **Consequences:** Provider can be swapped without touching views/components.

## ADR-008 — Scope: full-stack app with real data + paper trading

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The project began as a front-end showcase on mock data. Goal now is to
  demonstrate full-stack skills with real market data and real (paper) order flow.
- **Decision:** Expand scope to a full-stack app: live market data + symbol search, a
  persisted watchlist, and **paper trading via Alpaca**. Real money stays out of scope.
- **Consequences:** Requires external providers and (eventually) our own backend;
  roadmap re-planned into Phases 4–11.

## ADR-009 — Data providers

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Need trading + market data. Alpaca has no symbol search; Alpha Vantage's
  free tier is ~25 req/day (tight). Finnhub has a friendlier free tier (~60/min) with
  search, quotes, candles, news, and CORS.
- **Decision:** **Alpaca (paper)** for trading; **Finnhub** for market data + symbol
  search.
- **Consequences:** Two integrations (Finnhub + Alpaca). Caching still worthwhile;
  provider stays behind the service layer / BFF in case it changes.

## ADR-010 — Integration architecture: backend-for-frontend (BFF)

- **Status:** Accepted (direction), with an interim frontend-direct step
- **Context:** Alpaca keys are secret and its API isn't browser-CORS-friendly; market
  provider keys leak in the browser and free tiers need caching.
- **Decision:** **Trading always goes through our backend.** Market data may be called
  **frontend-direct as a local-dev spike only**; production routes everything through a
  thin **BFF** built as **TypeScript serverless functions (Vercel/Netlify)** that hides
  keys and caches.
- **Consequences:** Frontend calls only `/api/*` in the target state; the service layer
  isolates the frontend-direct → BFF transition.

## ADR-011 — Watchlist persistence

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Watchlist is user data but needs no external API to start.
- **Decision:** Persist in **`localStorage`** first (no backend); migrate to a backend +
  DB later for multi-device/multi-user.
- **Consequences:** Fast start; a later migration path when the BFF/DB exist.

## ADR-012 — Account model: single shared paper account

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Demonstrating paper trading doesn't require multi-user infrastructure.
- **Decision:** Use a **single shared Alpaca paper account** (no user auth) for the demo.
- **Consequences:** No auth/user system needed now; per-user accounts + auth remain a
  possible future extension (would likely use Alpaca Broker API).

## ADR-013 — Real-time quotes via Finnhub WebSocket

- **Status:** Accepted (interim frontend-direct, like ADR-010)
- **Context:** The watchlist showed static REST quotes. Live prices need a push feed;
  polling `/quote` per symbol would burn the free-tier quota. Finnhub offers a trade
  WebSocket (`wss://ws.finnhub.io`).
- **Decision:** Stream trades over a **single shared WebSocket** behind a new
  `marketStream` service (mirroring `marketData`). The store **buffers ticks and flushes
  the latest price per symbol every ~400ms**, recomputing change % from `previousClose`.
  The socket reconnects with exponential backoff and reconciles subscriptions as the
  watchlist changes. Called **frontend-direct in local dev only**; it moves behind the
  BFF (proxied WS/SSE) in Phase 6, same as REST.
- **Consequences:** Smooth live updates without hammering the REST quota; the buffer keeps
  re-renders cheap. Consumers depend only on a provider-agnostic `Trade` type, so the
  BFF transition won't touch stores or components. Ticks only arrive during market hours.

## ADR-014 — Chart data: synthetic candles now, real bars via the BFF later

- **Status:** Superseded by ADR-016 (real candles now served from Alpaca via the BFF)
- **Context:** The Chart page (Phase 5) needs OHLCV candles at several intervals.
  **Finnhub's `/stock/candle` is a premium endpoint** — a free key returns `403` — so
  there is no frontend-direct path for candles like there is for quotes/search.
- **Decision:** Generate **deterministic synthetic candles** on the client for now
  (`marketData.fetchCandles`, a seeded random walk keyed by symbol + timeframe, stable
  across reloads). Timeframe tabs are `{range, resolution}` presets (`CHART_TIMEFRAMES`).
  Keep it behind the service seam so **Phase 6 swaps in real bars — Alpaca IEX
  (`/v2/stocks/{symbol}/bars`, free) via the BFF** — without touching the store or the
  `PriceChart` component. Charting library: **TradingView `lightweight-charts` v5**
  (candlestick + overlay volume histogram; no built-in timeframe selector, so tabs are
  ours).
- **Consequences:** Chart UX is fully buildable now with no backend, keys, or market-hours
  dependency. Real candles are a drop-in later. Alpaca market data stays server-side
  (secret keys, CORS), consistent with ADR-010.

## ADR-015 — Concrete BFF: standalone Hono `/api`, in-memory cache, WS stays frontend-direct

- **Status:** Accepted (realizes ADR-010, Phase 6)
- **Context:** ADR-010 committed to a backend-for-frontend to hide keys and centralize
  the data layer. Phase 6 makes it concrete. Symbol search + quotes were still
  frontend-direct (exposed `VITE_FINNHUB_API_KEY`); we want them behind a server before
  layering on Portfolio and Alpaca paper trading.
- **Decision:** Stand up a **standalone Hono server in `server/`** (`@hono/node-server`,
  `tsx` in dev on `PORT` 8787) exposing `GET /api/health`, `/api/search?q=`, and
  `/api/quotes?symbols=`. The provider client + response mapping moved out of
  `src/services/marketData.ts` into `server/finnhub.ts`; the client service is now a thin
  `fetch('/api/*')` wrapper. **Vite proxies `/api` → the BFF** in dev, so the browser makes
  same-origin calls with no CORS and never sees the REST key. A small **in-memory TTL
  cache** (search ~1h, quotes ~10s) protects Finnhub's free-tier quota. Shared shapes
  (`Quote`, `SymbolSearchResult`) are imported type-only from `src/types/market.ts` so the
  contract stays single-source. **Scope is deliberately narrow:** candles stay mock and the
  **live WebSocket stays frontend-direct** (still carries `VITE_FINNHUB_API_KEY`).
- **Consequences:** The Finnhub REST key is server-side; stores/views were untouched thanks
  to the service seam. Two honest gaps remain, deferred by design: real candles (Alpaca IEX
  bars via the BFF) and **WS key-hiding** (proxied WS/SSE), both revisited later — the WS
  exposure is called out at deploy (Phase 12). The in-memory cache resets per process; a
  shared cache is only relevant once deployed serverless.

## ADR-016 — Real chart candles from Alpaca IEX via the BFF

- **Status:** Accepted (supersedes ADR-014, Phase 6)
- **Context:** ADR-014 shipped the Chart page on **synthetic** candles because Finnhub's
  `/stock/candle` is premium (free key → `403`). With the BFF in place (ADR-015), we can
  now hide provider keys server-side, so real candles are viable without exposing anything
  to the browser. Alpaca provides free historical bars (`GET /v2/stocks/{symbol}/bars`).
- **Decision:** Add a server-side Alpaca client (`server/alpaca.ts`) and a
  `GET /api/candles?symbol=&timeframe=` route. It fetches the **free `iex` feed** with
  `APCA-API-KEY-ID`/`APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` (from `ALPACA_API_KEY_ID` / `ALPACA_API_SECRET_KEY`,
  server-only), owns the timeframe → `{timeframe, limit, lookback}` mapping, requests
  `sort=desc` + an explicit `start` (Alpaca defaults `start` to the start of _today_, which
  would starve daily/weekly ranges) and reverses bars to oldest→newest, mapping
  `{t,o,h,l,c,v}` → `Candle` (epoch **seconds**). Results are cached (intraday ~30–60s,
  daily/weekly ~5m). The client `marketData.fetchCandles` becomes a thin `/api/candles`
  call and the synthetic generator is deleted. The TTL cache + provider-error type are
  factored into shared `server/cache.ts` + `server/errors.ts` (used by Finnhub too).
- **Consequences:** The Chart page runs on real market data with keys hidden and the store /
  `PriceChart` untouched (service seam held). Trade-offs of the free tier: `iex` is thinner
  than `sip` and the latest bar is ~15 min delayed; off-hours/invalid symbols may return few
  or no bars (the chart's empty/loading states already cover this). Alpaca **trading**
  (orders/positions) remains a later phase; the live WebSocket is still frontend-direct.

## ADR-017 — Alpaca account + positions via the BFF (read-only)

- **Status:** Accepted (Phase 7)
- **Context:** Portfolio (Phase 8) needs real holdings + account metrics. Rather than build
  it on mock data and rewire later, we fetch the real Alpaca data first. Account/positions
  live on Alpaca's **Trading API** (`paper-api.alpaca.markets`) — a different host from the
  market-data API (`data.alpaca.markets`) already used for candles — but share the same
  key/secret. No order placement yet (that's a write; Phase 9).
- **Decision:** Extend `server/alpaca.ts` with a second base URL (`ALPACA_TRADING_URL`,
  default `paper-api.alpaca.markets`) and a shared `alpacaRequest()` helper (auth headers +
  `ProviderError` mapping, reused by candles). Add `GET /api/account` → `fetchAccount()` and
  `GET /api/positions` → `fetchPositions()`. Alpaca returns numbers as strings, so the BFF
  parses them and maps: account → `PortfolioSummary` (`totalValue`=equity, `buyingPower`,
  `dayChange`=equity−`last_equity`, `dayChangePercent`); positions → `Position[]` (qty, side,
  avg entry, current price, market value, cost basis, unrealised P/L + intraday P/L). Cached
  ~5s. Client `marketData.fetchPortfolioSummary` now hits `/api/account` (mock deleted) and a
  new `fetchPositions` hits `/api/positions`; `usePortfolioStore` gains `positions` +
  `loadPositions()`. The existing Watchlist StatCards become real with no UI change.
- **Consequences:** Portfolio metrics are real and keys stay server-side; the Portfolio page
  (Phase 8) builds directly on `positions`. `dayChange` follows Alpaca's `last_equity`
  (previous trading day 16:00 ET), so it can read 0 outside market hours.
- **Follow-up (Phase 8):** added `GET /api/portfolio/history` → `fetchPortfolioHistory(range)`
  (`GET /v2/account/portfolio/history`), mapping the parallel `timestamp`/`equity` arrays to a
  `PortfolioHistory` series for the performance chart. A UI range (1W–ALL) maps to Alpaca's
  `period`/`timeframe`; leading pre-funding zero-equity points are dropped so the line starts
  at real money; cached ~30s. **Still deferred:** place/cancel + close-position (Phase 9) and
  account configurations (not needed now).

## ADR-018 — Alpaca paper trading (orders) via the BFF

- **Status:** Accepted (Phase 9)
- **Context:** The chart's order ticket was UI-only. Placing orders is the app's first
  **write** path, and Alpaca's trading API is both key-bearing and not browser-CORS-friendly,
  so it must stay server-side (ADR-009). Orders also change account equity and positions,
  which the BFF caches.
- **Decision:** Add four routes on the existing Trading host: `POST /api/orders`,
  `GET /api/orders`, `GET /api/orders/:id`, `DELETE /api/orders/:id`. Supporting changes:
  - `alpacaRequest()` grows `method`/`body` support and handles Alpaca's `204` (cancel).
  - **Error passthrough:** `403` (insufficient buying power) and `422` (bad params, unknown
    asset) keep their status and carry Alpaca's own `message` instead of being flattened into
    a generic `502`, because they're user-actionable. The client `api()` helper likewise
    prefers the BFF's `{ error }` text, so "insufficient buying power" reaches the toast.
    `401` still becomes `502` (that's a server misconfiguration, not a user error).
  - **Cache invalidation:** `server/cache.ts` gains `invalidate(...prefixes)`; every write
    drops `orders:`, `account`, `positions` and `history:` so a fill shows up immediately
    rather than after the 5s account TTL.
  - **Validation before spending an upstream call:** the route rejects a missing symbol,
    non-positive qty, unknown side/type/TIF, and a `limit`/`stop` order without its price.
  - **Ticket vs response types:** orders placed elsewhere (e.g. Alpaca's dashboard) can carry
    types/TIFs we don't offer, so `OrderType`/`OrderTimeInForce` cover Alpaca's full equity
    sets for _responses_, while `TicketOrderType`/`TicketTimeInForce` (`market|limit|stop`,
    `day|gtc`) constrain what we _place_.
  - **Polling, not streaming:** `useOrdersStore` re-polls every ~5s but only while an order is
    still working. Alpaca's trade-updates stream needs server-side auth and the
    WebSocket-behind-BFF item is still open from Phase 6, so it's deliberately out of scope.
  - UI: `OrderPanel` gains a time-in-force select and a review-and-confirm dialog; a new
    `OrdersCard` on the Portfolio page lists orders with status tags and cancels open ones.
- **Consequences:** Real paper orders work end to end with keys server-side, and fills flow
  into the portfolio without a manual refresh. Trade-offs: a `day` market order placed outside
  regular trading hours sits at `accepted` rather than filling, and polling means order state
  can lag by up to ~5s. **Security note for Phase 12:** the BFF has no auth, so a _deployed_
  instance would let anyone trade the shared paper account (ADR-012) — acceptable for local
  dev, but deploying needs at least a rate limit or a shared secret. **Deferred:**
  bracket/OCO/OTO classes, `PATCH` replace-order, close-position, cancel-all,
  options/crypto, and fractional/notional orders.

## ADR-019 — Orders get their own page; News dropped from scope

- **Status:** Accepted (Phase 9, follow-up)
- **Context:** Phase 9 first shipped the orders list as a card below Holdings on the Portfolio
  page. In practice that page then had **two large tables stacked**, which read as cluttered
  and left neither as the obvious primary content. The two also answer different questions:
  holdings are a _current-state snapshot_ you glance at, orders are a _time-ordered activity
  log_ you scan and act on. Meanwhile the nav had five primary items, one of which (`News`)
  was still an empty placeholder.
- **Decision:** Give orders a top-level route (`/orders`) and nav tab, and **remove News**
  entirely — nav item, route, stub view, and its roadmap/feature entries — freeing the slot so
  the nav item count stays at five (no mobile tab-bar layout change; that bar is flex-based
  with no cap). Nav order becomes Watchlist, Portfolio, Orders, Chart, Markets, keeping the two
  account pages adjacent. Because the page has room the card never had, it also gains
  **status filter tabs** (All / Open / Filled / Canceled) with live counts; the buckets are
  mutually exclusive and exhaustive (open → still working, filled → complete fill, canceled →
  every other terminal state) so the counts sum to All. Filtering is client-side over the
  already-polled list, so switching tabs is instant and costs no extra upstream calls.
  `OrdersCard` was split into `OrdersView` (owns the store, filter, and cancel/toast flow) and
  a presentational `OrdersTable` (rows in, `cancel` out). The order-polling lifecycle moved
  from `PortfolioView` to `OrdersView`, and polling now refreshes **silently**
  (`load(status, { silent: true })`) so it doesn't toggle the table's loading state every 5s.
- **Loading state:** we deliberately do **not** bind PrimeVue's `DataTable :loading`. Because
  cached BFF reads return in a few milliseconds, the `true → false` flip can orphan the
  overlay's leave-transition and strand a `p-datatable-mask` (with `pointer-events: auto`)
  over the table, silently swallowing clicks on the cancel buttons. The page renders a
  `ProgressSpinner` for the initial load instead.
- **Consequences:** Portfolio is back to a single table and reads cleaner; orders get room for
  filters and future columns. Two trade-offs: polling now only runs while the Orders page is
  open, so a fill that happens while you're elsewhere shows up on next visit rather than live
  (acceptable — the portfolio reloads after any write anyway); and News is no longer planned,
  so Phase 10 is Markets only. Finnhub's news endpoints simply go unused.

## ADR-020 — Markets page on US-listed proxies (Alpaca only)

- **Status:** Accepted (Phase 10)
- **Context:** The Markets page needs three things — benchmark index cards, movers tables and a
  sector heatmap — for **US and Canadian** markets. Two of those have no free data source:
  **index levels** (`^GSPC` / `^IXIC` / `^GSPTSE` are premium on Finnhub; Alpaca covers only
  US stocks and ETFs, so there is no free quote for an index itself) and **the TSX** (Finnhub's
  free tier is **US-only** — `RY.TO` returns `Symbol not supported` — and Alpaca doesn't list
  Canadian venues at all). Finnhub also has no screener endpoint, so despite the earlier roadmap
  note that Phase 10 would "consume Finnhub data", it turned out Finnhub can serve **none** of
  this page.
- **Decision:** Build the page entirely on **Alpaca's free Basic plan**, approximating the two
  gaps deliberately rather than paying for data or adding an unofficial provider:
  - **Indices → ETF proxies.** `SPY` (S&P 500), `QQQ` (Nasdaq 100), `DIA` (Dow 30),
    `IWM` (Russell 2000), `EWC` (Canada). The card shows the benchmark name with the proxy
    ticker beside it, so it never claims to be the index itself.
  - **Canada → US listings.** A curated universe of ~28 Canadian large caps by their **NYSE**
    listing (`RY`, `TD`, `ENB`, `CNQ`, `CNI`, `CP`, `SHOP`, `AEM`, …). Prices are USD and track
    the TSX lines closely, and — the deciding factor — every row stays **tradable in the paper
    account**, so clicking through to the chart and placing an order still works end to end.
    Real TSX symbols would be dead ends.
  - **Sectors.** US tiles are the 11 SPDR Select Sector ETFs. Canada has no US-listed sector
    ETFs, so its tiles are the equal-weighted mean of the curated universe grouped by sector —
    derived from the snapshot the movers table already fetched, at no extra upstream cost.
- **Honesty in the UI:** `MarketMovers.source` distinguishes `screener` (a real whole-market
  scan) from `universe` (the curated Canadian list), and the card subtitle says which. Sector
  tiles show either the backing ETF or an "N holdings" count. A curated list never reads as a
  full-market scan.
- **Filtering the screener:** Alpaca's movers/most-actives rank the raw tape, which is topped by
  instruments no trading app would surface — live samples included `ATTO +4544%`, `MUA.RT` at
  $0.004 and `FTHAW` (a warrant) at $0.63. Ranked lists were also swamped by **geared
  single-stock ETFs**, which is structural rather than incidental: a 2x fund mechanically
  out-moves whatever it tracks, so left alone the board fills with derivatives of the same few
  stocks. So we over-fetch the screener's maximum (`top=50`) and filter down: price ≥ $5,
  `|change|` ≤ 100% (a bigger day is almost always a reverse split, not a move), then a
  `GET /v2/assets/{symbol}` lookup (cached 24h — names are static) to drop non-tradable symbols,
  odd exchanges, warrants/rights/units, and any name that looks like both a fund _and_ a geared
  one. That lookup does double duty: the screener returns symbols only, so it's also where
  company names come from. Plain 1x funds are kept — they're ordinary instruments.
- **Requests:** everything is batched. `GET /v2/stocks/snapshots?symbols=…` prices a whole list
  in one call (`dailyBar` vs `prevDailyBar` for the day's move), and one multi-symbol
  `/v2/stocks/bars` call covers all five index sparklines. `/v2/clock` drives a market-status
  pill and gates polling, which runs every 60s **only while the market is open** — prices don't
  move overnight, so polling then would just burn quota. TTLs: clock/indices 30s, movers and
  sectors 60s, assets 24h.
- **Consequences:** The whole page runs on one provider and the free tier, with no new keys.
  Prices carry the same IEX caveat as the chart (ADR-016): `prevDailyBar` is consolidated but
  intraday values are IEX-only, so they can lag the composite slightly. The curated Canadian
  universe is **hand-maintained** — it won't track index membership changes, and its
  "gainers/losers" are only the ends of ~28 names, not a market scan. Real TSX coverage stays
  out of scope until there's a data source that justifies it. Shared Alpaca transport moved to
  `server/alpacaClient.ts` so `alpaca.ts` and `markets.ts` can both use it.

---

## ADR-021 — Deploy to Netlify: Functions BFF, WS stays frontend-direct, auth gap accepted

- **Status:** Accepted (Phase 12)
- **Context:** The BFF (`server/`) was a standalone `@hono/node-server` process, fine for
  local dev but not directly deployable to Netlify, which runs static assets + serverless
  functions rather than a long-lived Node process. Two open items were already flagged for
  this phase: the live WebSocket is still frontend-direct (ADR-015), and the BFF has no auth
  (ADR-018), which matters once `/api/orders` is reachable by anyone.
- **Decision:** Four deploy choices:
  - **BFF → Netlify Function.** Extracted the Hono app + all routes out of `server/index.ts`
    into a runtime-agnostic `server/app.ts` (just the `Hono` instance, no `serve()`/`dotenv`).
    `server/index.ts` keeps the local-dev entry point (`@hono/node-server`, unchanged
    behavior); a new `netlify/functions/api.ts` mounts the same app via `hono/netlify`'s
    `handle()` for production. `netlify.toml` redirects `/api/*` to the function (mirroring
    the Vite dev proxy) and adds an SPA fallback (`/* → /index.html`) since
    `src/router/index.ts` uses `createWebHistory`.
  - **Git-based continuous deployment.** The repo is on GitHub; Netlify's dashboard is
    connected directly to it, so every push to `main` triggers a build + deploy with no CLI
    or agent step. No Netlify MCP server was available, so the one-time GitHub-App
    authorization and env var setup were done by hand in Netlify's UI.
  - **WS stays frontend-direct, kept as-is.** `VITE_FINNHUB_API_KEY` still ships in the
    client bundle in production. Netlify Functions can't hold a persistent WebSocket open,
    so proxying it server-side would need a different runtime (a small always-on process
    elsewhere) — out of scope for this deploy. Accepted because it's a **read-only
    market-data key** with no trading power; exposure only risks API quota, not money.
  - **BFF auth gap accepted, not fixed.** `/api/orders` (place/cancel) and account/positions
    remain unauthenticated in production, same as local dev. It's a **paper** account
    (fake money, ADR-012), so the acceptable-risk case from ADR-018 was taken as-is rather
    than adding a shared secret or rate limit. _(Superseded for the write routes by
    ADR-024, which gates order placement and cancellation behind a passcode session.)_
- **Consequences:** The frontend/BFF split needed no rearchitecting — only an extra thin
  entry point — because the service-layer seam (ADR-010) and the shared `server/app.ts`
  kept provider logic in one place. Two honest, documented gaps ship to production: the
  Finnhub WS key is publicly visible in the bundle, and the shared paper account is
  reachable by anyone with the URL. Both are called out here rather than left implicit;
  revisiting either (WS-behind-a-proxy, a shared-secret header, or rate limiting) remains
  straightforward future work if the project's risk profile changes.

## ADR-022 — Symbol search: selecting a result opens the chart; watchlist toggle moves to a per-row star button

- **Status:** Accepted (Polish)
- **Context:** `SymbolSearch.vue` originally treated "select a result" and "add to
  watchlist" as the same action — clicking a dropdown row called
  `useWatchlistStore.add()` directly and showed a toast, with no way to reach a symbol's
  chart from search at all. Every other symbol touchpoint in the app (Watchlist rows,
  Markets movers/index cards/sectors) instead opens `/chart/:symbol` on click, so search
  was the inconsistent one, and conflated two distinct intents (look something up vs.
  follow it) into a single click.
- **Decision:** Split the two actions. Selecting a row (click or Enter) now navigates to
  `router.push({ name: 'chart', params: { symbol } })`, matching the rest of the app.
  A small star `Button` on each row (filled/`success` when already followed, outline/
  `secondary` otherwise) toggles watchlist membership via the existing
  `useWatchlistStore.add()` / `remove()`, using `@click.stop` so it never bubbles into
  PrimeVue's `option-select` and the dropdown stays open — letting a user add several
  symbols in one search session before navigating away.
- **Consequences:** Search now behaves consistently with every other symbol list in the
  app, and watchlist management from search is explicit and reversible in place (no need
  to visit the Watchlist page to undo an accidental add). No store or BFF changes were
  needed — `useWatchlistStore` already exposed both `add()` and `remove()`.

---

## ADR-023 — Chart page: symbol-info header sourced from Alpaca + Finnhub, and order-panel alignment fix

- **Status:** Accepted (Polish)
- **Context:** Two issues surfaced on the Chart page. First, `OrderPanel` looked
  visually unaligned with the chart card: the symbol/price header lived inside the
  _left_ grid column above the chart card, so the order panel (the grid's other
  column) started level with the header text rather than the chart card's top edge.
  Second, the secondary Open/High/Low/Vol row was computed from whichever candles
  happened to be loaded for the _selected timeframe_ (`useChartStore`) — so switching
  to `1Y` showed a year's open/high/low instead of today's, and there was no market
  cap, 52-week range, P/E or dividend yield anywhere, despite `docs/05-features.md`
  already claiming "key stats". Alpaca (already used for candles/markets/account) has
  no fundamentals data at any tier — confirmed against its Market Data API docs — so
  it can supply today's session (open/high/low/previous close/volume, via the same
  `/v2/stocks/snapshots` shape `server/markets.ts` uses) but not 52-week range, market
  cap, P/E or dividend yield. Finnhub's free tier does carry those via
  `/stock/metric?metric=all` (Basic Financials), the same plan already used for search
  and quotes.
- **Decision:** Pulled the symbol header out of the two-column grid into its own
  full-width `SymbolStatsHeader` component rendered above it, so the chart card and
  `OrderPanel` now start at the same line; `OrderPanel` is also `lg:sticky` so it
  stays in view while scrolling. `SymbolStatsHeader` shows the existing
  candle-derived price/change (unchanged — intentionally timeframe-relative), then a
  day-stats row and a fundamentals row (plus a 52-week range bar with a marker at the
  current price) sourced from a new combined `/api/stats?symbol=` BFF endpoint:
  `server/stats.ts` runs an Alpaca snapshot and a Finnhub metrics call in parallel and
  merges them into one `StockStats` object, cached 30s. `useChartStore` fetches this
  once per symbol change (not per timeframe change, since it's timeframe-independent)
  and the old candle-derived `open`/`high`/`low`/`volume` computeds were removed now
  that real stats replace them.
- **Consequences:** The header now shows numbers a trading app is expected to have,
  they're now always correct regardless of which timeframe tab is active, and the
  order panel finally reads as aligned with the chart. The Finnhub metrics call is
  fault-tolerant (`.catch` falls back to just the Alpaca day stats) so a Finnhub
  hiccup only drops the fundamentals row, not the whole header. `market cap` and the
  average-volume fields, which Finnhub reports in millions, are converted to plain
  units in the mapping so the client only ever deals with real dollar/share figures.

## ADR-024 — Auth: a passcode session guards the order writes; every read stays public

- **Status:** Accepted (Polish)
- **Context:** ADR-021 shipped the BFF to Netlify unauthenticated, accepting that anyone
  with the URL could place or cancel orders on the shared paper account. That's survivable
  because the money is fake (ADR-012), but a visitor can still empty the portfolio, and a
  trading app with a wide-open write path is a bad look on a portfolio piece. The obvious
  fix — a real auth provider (Netlify Identity, Clerk, Auth0, Supabase) — solves a problem
  this app doesn't have: there is exactly **one** Alpaca paper account and no user model,
  so per-user sign-up would create accounts that all read and write the same portfolio.
  Netlify Identity was the closest fit (it's native to the host, and its planned
  deprecation was reversed in Feb 2026), but its server-side helpers need `netlify dev`
  locally — replacing the current Vite + `tsx watch` loop — and calling them inside
  `server/app.ts` would couple the deliberately runtime-agnostic app to Netlify, undoing
  the property ADR-021 was built around.
- **Decision:** Gate on the **write/read** boundary rather than the "trading vs market
  data" one, with a single owner passcode:
  - **Only `POST /api/orders` and `DELETE /api/orders/:id` require a session.** Account,
    positions, portfolio history and order history stay public — they're read-only views
    of a fake-money account with no personal data, and they're what makes the deployed
    demo worth looking at. Locking them would leave a visitor on empty pages.
  - **Passcode → signed cookie, no dependencies.** `POST /api/auth/login` compares the
    submitted value against `APP_PASSCODE` with `timingSafeEqual`, then issues a 7-day
    HS256 JWT (signed with `SESSION_SECRET`, carrying only `exp`) as an `HttpOnly`,
    `SameSite=Lax` cookie. Hono already ships `hono/jwt`, `hono/cookie` and
    `timingSafeEqual`, so nothing was added to `package.json`. A stateless token matters
    on Netlify, where consecutive requests can hit different function instances — the same
    reason `cache.ts` is per-instance.
  - **`Secure` is derived from the request scheme**, not `NODE_ENV`, keeping `server/auth.ts`
    free of runtime checks: `Secure` cookies are dropped over the plain-HTTP dev server but
    always set in production.
  - **The UI degrades to read-only rather than hiding.** `OrderPanel`'s submit button
    becomes "Sign in to trade", the Orders page drops its per-row cancel button, and the
    top-bar avatar shows a lock. The user menu's dead `Profile` item was removed (there is
    no profile) and `Settings` finally routes somewhere. A `401` on any write flips
    `useAuthStore` back to signed out and reopens the prompt, so an expired cookie
    self-corrects mid-session.
- **Consequences:** The hole that mattered is closed — a stranger can browse everything but
  can't touch the account — for one new server module and no new dependencies. The cost is
  that the passcode is private, so a recruiter can never place a trade themselves; the
  order panel is a locked shop window. Two gaps remain open and are deliberately not
  addressed here: the public read endpoints are still an unmetered proxy to the Finnhub and
  Alpaca quotas (a rate limit would be per-instance on Netlify, hence approximate), and the
  live WebSocket still carries `VITE_FINNHUB_API_KEY` in the bundle (ADR-015/021). This is
  auth scoped to the actual risk, not a user system: if the app ever needs per-user
  watchlists or its own Alpaca sub-accounts, this gets replaced rather than extended.

## ADR-025 — Polish: state placeholders live in the store, accessibility in the markup

- **Status:** Accepted (Phase 11)
- **Context:** Ten phases of feature work left the app's _edges_ inconsistent. Loading was
  whatever each page reached for at the time — `DataTable :loading` on Watchlist and
  Holdings (the exact binding `CLAUDE.md` warns leaves a click-blocking mask), a centred
  `ProgressSpinner` on Orders and Markets, and nothing at all behind the stat cards and
  `SymbolStatsHeader`, which sat at `—` and `$0.00` until data landed and then jumped.
  Only `OrdersView` and `MarketsView` distinguished a first load from a refresh, and they
  did it in the view (`loading && items.length === 0`), so the 5s order poll and the 60s
  markets poll happened not to flash — by luck of where the check lived, not by design.
  Accessibility had a decent floor (landmarks, `aria-label` on icon buttons, signed
  numbers rather than colour alone) with specific holes: no `<h1>` on the two most
  important pages, one `document.title` for the whole SPA, the symbol search and the
  entire order ticket unlabelled, `MoversTable` rows navigable by mouse only, and two
  canvas charts completely invisible to assistive tech.
- **Decision:**
  - **"Is this the first load?" is store state, not view state.** Each fetch concern sets
    a `hasLoaded` flag in its `finally` (on failure too) and exposes an `initialLoading`
    computed. Views render placeholders off that and never off raw `loading`, so a
    refresh, a poll and a range switch update in place by default. Where a user-initiated
    refetch _should_ signal progress (chart timeframe, portfolio range) the old data stays
    up under a translucent spinner rather than being replaced.
  - **Two shared primitives, not per-page markup.** `EmptyState` (icon, headline,
    explanation, optional action) and `TableSkeleton` (a header row plus placeholder
    rows). The skeleton renders _instead of_ the table rather than over it — that
    sidesteps PrimeVue's orphaned-mask bug by construction instead of remembering not to
    trigger it.
  - **"Empty" and "broken" are different states.** An error with no cached data gets its
    own `EmptyState` ("Orders are unavailable") alongside the technical `Message`, instead
    of an error banner over a blank card or, worse, an empty-state that blames the user.
  - **Canvas charts get a sentence, not a table.** `PriceChart` / `PortfolioChart` take an
    `ariaLabel` and expose `role="img"` — "NVDA 1D candlestick chart. $212.96, +0.93% over
    the range." A full data-table alternative was rejected: the numbers it would list are
    already on screen in `SymbolStatsHeader` and the holdings table.
  - **Route changes are announced.** `meta.title` per route drives both `document.title`
    and an `aria-live="polite"` region, because an SPA navigation moves neither focus nor
    the screen reader's cursor.
  - **`min-width` on tables is a floor, not a target.** `tableStyle="min-width"` was
    initially set by eye and _stretched_ tables past the viewport, pushing Change % and
    Total P/L out of view — the opposite of the intent. Each is now tuned to the table's
    measured min-content width, and mobile additionally drops the avatar and the
    lowest-priority column per table so the remaining columns fit a 375px screen.
- **Consequences:** Every surface now has a defined look for loading, empty and broken,
  and the rules for which one shows live in one place per concern. Three latent bugs fell
  out of the audit and are fixed: a Markets region switch captioned the outgoing region's
  rows with the incoming region's scope, `setSymbol` left the previous symbol's candles
  under the loading state (so the header's price briefly described the wrong stock), and
  `loadStats` swallowed its error so a failed Finnhub call was indistinguishable from a
  symbol with no fundamentals. Deliberately **not** done: no automated accessibility test
  (axe, Playwright) — the app has one unit test and adding a whole harness for a solo
  portfolio piece isn't worth it, so this pass is a point-in-time audit that a future
  change can regress.

- **Colour contrast — the domain tokens are now theme-aware.** An eyeball review passed
  them; computing WCAG relative luminance against the surfaces they actually sit on did
  not. The single `#16c784` / `#ea3943` pair was tuned for near-black, and the green as
  text on a light card is **2.20:1** — under half the 4.5:1 floor — so every light-theme
  `PriceTag` gain failed, as did the white label on the `bg-buy` fill at the same ratio.

  The decision was to give **each theme its own tone** rather than hunt for one compromise
  pair that satisfies both. The vivid tones stay on dark surfaces, where the green is
  already 7.86:1; light mode overrides them to `#0d774f` / `#c73039` on
  `:root:not(.app-dark)` — a `:not()` rather than a plain `:root` so it outranks the
  `@theme` defaults without depending on cascade-layer ordering. The dark red is also
  nudged to `#ec4d56`, lifting it from 4.25:1 to 4.75:1 on a card.

  Overriding the **tokens** instead of adding light-mode utilities at each call site is
  what preserves the single-source rule: `buy`/`sell`/`profit`/`loss` follow because they
  alias `up`/`down`, both charts follow because they read the tokens via `getComputedStyle`
  on an existing `ui.isDark` watcher, and the sector heatmap follows because its tints are
  opacity modifiers on the same tokens. Only one thing could not be aliased — a filled
  button's label, since a per-theme fill needs near-black on dark and white on light. Hence
  `--color-buy-contrast` / `--color-sell-contrast`, deliberately not derived from
  `up`/`down` because they are the inverse of the fill, not the same value.

  Auditing every rendered text node rather than the tokens alone then turned up three
  failures unrelated to the domain colours, all the same shape — text over a tint, where
  the tint erodes a ratio that passes on plain card:

  | Element                                                      | Was    | Fix                                                                                        |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `SectorHeatmap` label on the strongest tile                  | 4.14:1 | top shade capped at 40% opacity, label off `text-muted-color` (only 4.8:1 even untinted)   |
  | Active nav item: Aura light `primary.500` on `bg-primary/15` | 3.74:1 | light scheme's primary/hover/active shifted one step down the ramp (600/700/800)           |
  | `SelectButton` resting label on its own `slate.100` track    | 4.34:1 | `togglebutton.color` → `surface.600`, stepping cleanly into the existing `slate.700` hover |

  The audit now reports zero failures across all six routes in both themes, including both
  states of the Buy/Sell toggle. Independently of the ratios, colour is never the sole
  carrier of meaning — every price is signed or arrowed — so WCAG 1.4.1 holds regardless.

### Open decisions (not yet resolved)

- Dedicated Home/Dashboard landing page vs landing on Watchlist.
- Consistent search placeholder text.
- Logo placement (sidebar vs top bar).

## ADR-026 - AI research evidence boundary and paper-only transport

Add research services alongside the existing dashboard rather than replacing its stores or broker integration. Research uses validated nullable evidence and source timestamps; daily indicators exclude the current partial session. Keep research owner-authenticated and order-free. Reject non-official Alpaca hosts, live trading destinations and redirects at the shared transport. Default AI operation remains disabled RESEARCH_ONLY. Durable journal, risk controls and reconciliation must precede any automated execution. See [the phased architecture review](09-ai-trading-architecture.md) for file plans, conventions and remaining gates.

## ADR-027 - Durable local research, risk and paper execution

Implement the remaining AI-agent phases as small server modules and an additive AI Research route. Use Node SQLite with FULL synchronous WAL, immutable decisions/events, a unique client-order intent and an execution lease. Reserve before broker submission and reconcile ambiguous outcomes without retries. The existing Alpaca wrapper remains the only submission implementation. The model receives no trading tools and returns schema-validated, evidence-cited research. Deterministic strategy/risk code is shared by paper and offline replay.

Every restart pauses the local agent in RESEARCH_ONLY. MANUAL_APPROVAL revalidates fresh inputs; AUTO_PAPER requires explicit environment and dashboard opt-ins. Emergency stop never liquidates. Netlify does not initialize the SQLite/scheduler runtime. Analytics attribute fill P/L to agent trades, keep account equity distinct, and return null for missing marks. Replay uses archived availability timestamps and next-open fills, never today's fundamentals for past decisions. See [the operational guide](10-ai-agent-setup.md) for test coverage and remaining modeling limits.
